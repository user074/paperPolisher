# paperPolisher
Using ChatGPT to polish your academic paper. Still under development but works for txt input files. It keeps Latex and overleaf formatting and citiations most of time (not guaranteed). It also keeps the original paper structure. It is not perfect but it is a good start...

The cost for one paper is roughly about $0.4 to $0.5 USD. Depends on length. You can run the support functions section then run the cost estimation function to get an estimate of the cost for free.


Steps to run it:
1. Open the paperPolisher.ipynb file in Colab
2. Put your origional paper into the repo as txt file (Copy & Paste into txt works)
3. Put your openai api key in the setup section.
4. Change filename = 'YOUR_ORIGIONAL_PAPER_FILE_NAME.txt'
5. Run the required support functions.
6. Then run the last section you should get a polished paper as 'polished_YOUR_ORIGIONAL_PAPER_FILE_NAME.txt'
